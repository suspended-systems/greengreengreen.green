- auto gen'd spending habit replacement recommendations panel in transactions tab
- "Warning: you'll be in the red starting on {DATE}" calendar view with go to date button
- chat response text streaming / animation
- make the chat results experience better. Maybe shrink the text input on results loading. Maybe each option can be "retried" and given a reason why it is not liked/curator experience
- tx table column for adjusted {daily} cost or whatever time unit you choose (drop down menu). So you can sort by adjusted cost
- improve mobile tab buttons: adjust things so tab elements are not overlaying, so scroll bottom touches top of tab buttons  
- Allow typing date instead of date picker
- show recurring icon in item list calendar view 
- calendar filtering like "only show expenses over $50", "hide recurring", "only recurring", etc
- "build a profile for me" AI button for rent, utilities as individual water trash gas etc, internet, gas, car insurance, or as onboarding
- capital one/discover integration / variable payment support, more transaction kinds support in general (insurance, loans, etc)
- tour "skip" button setting tutorial complete (bug with joyride)
- more friendly/professional green service account email
- toggles for calendar day card view
    -show all names of transactions
    -show just totals
    -show individiual
- assign happiness points to transactions
- categorize transactions
- represent recurring date as more complex things like "last friday of every month" so start date is just day of month for example not a specific day, "twice a week for six months"
